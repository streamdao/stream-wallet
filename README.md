# StreamDAO Wallet

StreamPay Wallet is the contactless, simplest mobile wallet for the Solana ecosystem.

To try it out do the following:

1. Download Expo Go here: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779
2. Go to this link and scan the QR code (this will open the app in Expo Go): exp://exp.host/@streamdao/wallet?release-channel=default
3. Connect your wallet, explore the app and make a trade and trade USDC for STRM for a guaranteed successful trade (switching out data providers right now so other tokens are broken).

StreamPay is a non-custodial wallet and therefore does not store data about you or your wallet. Your wallet secret phrase is encrypted on the device and can only be accessed using the passcode you set up locally.
