# Stream Wallet

StreamPay Wallet is the contactless, simplest mobile wallet for the Solana ecosystem.

#### Its on alpha stage, be careful when using it. To try it out do the following:

1. Download Expo Go here: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779
2. Go to this link and scan the QR code (this will open the app in Expo Go): https://expo.dev/@streamdao/wallet?release-channel=default
3. Connect your wallet, explore the app and make a trade and trade USDC for STR for a guaranteed successful trade (switching out data providers right now so other tokens are broken).

StreamPay is a non-custodial wallet and therefore does not store data about you or your wallet. Your wallet secret phrase is encrypted on the device and can only be accessed using the passcode you set up locally.

####  Example 

Relevant data. Read more in "How Expo Works".

When you publish a project you are given a manifest URL. This is where your app will look for updates in the future. The URL you are given is not directly accessible in the web browser without adding some additional headers or parameters.

For example, the manifest URL for the app with the slug native-component-list published by the user community is https://exp.host/@community/native-component-list. If we want to inspect this in our web browser, we can add /index.exp?sdkVersion=37.0.0 to it. The end result is: https://exp.host/@community/native-component-list/index.exp?sdkVersion=37.0.0.


#### Project page

When you successfully run expo publish for your project, a project page is created that shows your app icon and description, and includes a QR code that can be scanned to open the app in some situations.

The Expo client app for Android can open any app, but due to limitations of the iOS platform, you are only able to view your own projects or projects published to a development team that you are a member of. This is useful in testing and ongoing development work, but rather than sharing your project page to end-users you should deploy to app stores.
